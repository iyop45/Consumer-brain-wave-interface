# Designing a consumer product to measure and categorise brain wave compositions and map them to actions

## Significant challenges
1. Sensitive probes to measure the low frequency, low voltage brain waves with poor physical contact
2. Making sure there is sufficient electrical insulation to ensure the user is safe
